## whats different about this one

> tl;dr read ./enabled-plugins.txt

i used to have one big plugins.lua with all my plugins. this was a bit of a
hassle because whenever i update it, lazy will fail to load the other plugins
(including the theme), so i had to close neovim again and reopen it.

sometimes i want to enable or disable a plugin. of course i can just use
`enabled = false`, but lazy still needs to parse it which is slow in my eyes. so
i just comment it in my big plugins.lua which is kinda hard to navigate if you
dont have folds, and even then its still chunky.

i wanted to try what everyone else was doing so now its all fragmented into
their own .lua file, so i can just put it in the folder (`lua/pluggers`) that
lazy.nvim uses and it is enabled.

then i got a problem to solve. theres too much friction moving plugins using
`mv PLUGIN.lua disabled/PLUGIN.lua` when i wanted to disable one. and i wanted
to categorize them so its easy which plugin i wanna change or add to.

i first tried using shell scriptinng and it was horrible. probably because im
bad at making scripts but i more blamed it on shell being a shitty language to
write in

so i created [relink.go] which basically automates symlinking by the
[enabled-plugins.txt] file and it works wonderfully tbh. and much easier to
write than in shell. probably the first time i ever used go as a sort of cli
tool or script or even just making my own cli for a specific purpose

## plugins i have to look into

- [ ] pho

- [bullets.vim](https://github.com/bullets-vim/bullets.vim) i need to fix to
  config of this
- [mini.move](https://github.com/nvim-mini/mini.move) adds the primeagen mapping
  to move a selaction up and down

- [grug-far.nvim](https://github.com/MagicDuck/grug-far.nvim) so that i dont use
  this, i should really setup a keybind/or atleast a note on how to do good
  native search and replace
  1. populate the arglist using telescope `<Leader>fl` or `Telescope live_grep`
  2. `:cdo %s/{old}/{new}/g`

  - [mini.hues](https://github.com/nvim-mini/mini.hues)

## plugins i looked into

- [Neogen](https://github.com/danymat/neogen) (kinda interesting)
  - automatically puts an annotation which is very nice and works better than
    snippets can
  - mainly for like lua it does well
- Bufferline plugins (mini.tabline, bufferline.nvim, etc...)
  - I've been thinking about how you should go about in a project and I am
    currently trying to ditch bufferlines or buffer related workflow and try
    ThePrimeagen's Harpoon where he sets 4 main files that he constantly goes to
    and only goes to the other files via file picker or lsp get def.
  - My buffer workflow
    - It's basically just vim tabs but better
    - How
      - open a workspace with
        [persistence.nvim](https://github.com/folke/persistence.nvim)
      - persistence will open all the buffers you used before
      - go through the buffers one by one
      - or jump to a specific buffer with a single chord
      - close a buffer if you no longer need it
      - use any file picker to open the file you want in a buffer
        - Telescope or netrw
    - Keybindings
      - Tab, <S-Tab> = :bnext, :bprev
      - <A-[1-9]> = jump to bufferline index 1-9
      - <Leader>c = close buffer
- [netrw.nvim](https://github.com/prichrd/netrw.nvim)
  - netrw is mid i just realized, never having ts ever again :pray:
  - oil.nvim or fyler.nvim is fetter

## Shitty idea

> what if i make a neovim distro purely made to be mouse and input mode only

> sounds stupid but there is a lack of extremely lightweight (i. e. cli/tui)
> text editors out there that have good functionality

> and its made for people who wont even learn vim motions but be able to use its
> amazing ecosystem - im gonna name it devil.nvim (de-evil like evil mode in
> emacs) or like good.nvim (opposite of evil) - or like neo as in taking the vim
> out of neovim

> kinda like a modern [evim](https://linux.die.net/man/1/evim)

## install

> you might wanna do the uninstall instruction first so no conflicts arise

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GravityShark/nvim-kick.git ~/.config/nvim
cd ~/.config/nvim
git config --local include.path ../.gitconfig
# then run the relink command with your preferred plugins
./relink.out
```

> then you go ahead change the lua/ensure.lua to set what kind of lsp,
> treesitter, formatters, and linters you wanna have

then run `nvim` or wheatever neovim client you use

> like [neovide](https://neovide.dev/)

## uninstall

```bash
# will completely remove anything in neovim
rm -rf ~/.config/nvim
rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim
rm -rf ~/.local/state/nvim
rm -rf ~/.cache/nvim

- thanks [kickstart.nvim]

## note
nvim servers exist, might use it to create cool shit like cool tranitions with mini.color a

```
