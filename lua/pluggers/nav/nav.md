# nav.md

**nav** is navigation for short.

These are plugins that fundamentally change how you navigate neovim that doesn't
involve editor stuff.

## arrow

Hints based harpoon, with a custom ui

## chadtree

CHAD file tree, better than that NERD tree

## fyler

Buffer based file tree, currently kinda unstable and I want to replace oil.nvim
with this just so i can have a side bar feature but it can't do that yet.

## mini.visits (incomplete)

Less of a standalone plugin, and more of a utility to allow you to visit recent
buffer you went through and filter through them. Requires a lot of extra setup
and I don't think I even did that tbh.

## _minipoon_

Based version of harpoon

## _oil_

Oil up your file system cause we are schmovin'. File management as a neovim
buffer

## pathfinder

Upgrades `gf` to do more shit

## _snipe_

Best way to get back to the buffer you've lost track and you forgot to add a
harpoon mark on

## trouble

Oooh boy you're in a lot of trouble, go find it usnig `<leader>ce`
