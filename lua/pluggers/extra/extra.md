# Extra Plugins

These plugins add _extra_ functionality that doesn't really fit the categories
of UI or Editing improvements

This means adding new features that add onto neovim, but doesn't fundamentally
change how you use it.

## fugitive

- Adds `:Git` and `:GBrowse,` see `:fugitive` when you have loaded it

## live-preview

- Adds `:LivePreview`, see `h livepreview` when you have loaded it

## obsidian

Adds [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) like features, should only apply on the
defined obsidian vault, yay!
