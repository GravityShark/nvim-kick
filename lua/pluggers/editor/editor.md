Plugins here are about improving the editing experience of neovim

They fundamentally change how you interact with neovim editing any text, not
specific to just coding.

## flash

Navigate your code with search labels, enhanced character motions and Treesitter
integration.

## _gitsigns_

shows the diff inside the gutter + git related features based on hunks

## _guess-indent_

Smartly reads the buffer and guesses the indent size the buffer uses and sets it
Even works on obscenely long files without lagging

## hardtime

Actually doesn't improve your editing experience, but it stops commands that do

a bad habit, which allows you to establish good command workflow and quit the
bad habit

## _mini_.ai

Improves on the a/i text objects

## _mini.jump_

Greatly improves the f/F/t/T motions

## mini.move

Moves selected text inuitively by C, left right up and down

## mini.operators

Adds small little commands that serve as shortcuts to stuff g= evaluate gx
exchange gm multiply gr replace gs sort

## _mini.pairs_

Automatically adds and deletes pair couples when typing the opening couple () {}
[] '' "" ``

## _mini.surround_

Adds keybindings that allow you to surround any object with a character and more

## multicursors

Adds the ever so waitied multicursors.

I'm personally waiting for official native neovim multicursors.

## treewalker

Tree sitter based movement

## _undotree_

Open a menu of a tree of all undos
